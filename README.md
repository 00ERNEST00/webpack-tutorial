This repo contains what was demonstrated on [Uppsala.js, November 3, 2016](http://www.meetup.com/Uppsalajs/events/234800307/).

Tutorial explains:

* What is Webpack
* Webpack vs Gulp, Grunt, Browserify, Rollup, NPM Scripts
* How to create a production ready bundle
* How to do code splitting
* How to do dead code elimination
* How to do tree shaking to remove dead code

* How to do hot/live reload
* How to use ES6/ES.next/ES2015 code in production with Babel
* How to load images
* How to load style (css)
* ...and more
